<h2>Why pick a haiku?</h2>
<p>
  This site has been built so you can look through haikus and choose your favorite. Two haikus from our databse will be randomly selected and you simply have to choose which you like the most. Some haikus are randomly genereated by the Ruby gem haiku_gadget and some are carefuly crafted by users.

<h2>What is there to see?</h2>
<p>
  The results of the likes are tallied so users can see which haikus are the favorites and if people generally prefer a haiku crafted by a human or generated by a computer.
